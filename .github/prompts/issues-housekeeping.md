# Issues Housekeeping

## Objective

Sweep all open issues for staleness, duplicates, batch-consolidation opportunities (sets of small related issues addressable together), label drift, priority accuracy, dependency status, and orphaned autowork claims, and land any accumulated draft log-only PRs. Fix what can be fixed and post a summary of changes made.

## Definition of Done

The run is SUCCESS only if ALL of these are true:

- [ ] All open issues have been scanned
- [ ] Priority review completed: P1s re-evaluated, quick-win promotions considered, priority rubric enforced
- [ ] Duplicate & batch-consolidation check completed: overlapping issues closed with cross-references, small related issues consolidated
- [ ] Stale / obsolete check completed: premise-obsolete issues closed, idle issues resolved
- [ ] Label audit completed: every open issue has consistent type, size, and priority labels
- [ ] Dependency check completed: issues with `## Dependencies` verified against blocker status
- [ ] Orphaned-claim sweep completed: stale autowork claims (per `ORCHESTRATION.md`) released back to the unclaimed pool
- [ ] Draft log-only PR sweep completed: open draft PRs whose changed files are entirely under `.github/prompts/logs/**` undrafted and squash-merged
- [ ] Summary posted listing all changes made

If any criterion cannot be met, stop immediately and log FAILURE with the reason.

## Constraints

- **Max iterations**: 40 — after 40 tool call rounds without completing Definition of Done, STOP. Log FAILURE with category `token_limit`.
- **Max scope**: housekeeping only. Do not implement code fixes or open feature PRs.
- **No speculative work**: only modify issue metadata (labels, status, comments, releasing stale assignees) and land draft log-only PRs.
- **Language Requirement**: All GitHub issue titles, descriptions, task checklists, and comments MUST be written in **English**.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Quick Recovery & Clearing

1. **Draft log-only PR sweep**: Undraft and squash-merge open draft PRs whose diffs are entirely under `.github/prompts/logs/**`.
2. **Orphaned-claim sweep**: Sweep assigned issues. If an issue meets the 3 stale-claim conditions in `ORCHESTRATION.md` (autowork claim comment, no open PR, comment > 6 hours old), re-read immediately before writing, unassign the dead owner, and post a release comment.

### Phase 2: Backlog Hygiene

3. **Priority review**: Check open P1/P2/P3 issues. Promote critical bugs or unblocked items; demote items that lack immediate priority.
4. **Duplicate & consolidation check**: Identify duplicate issues; close duplicates with cross-references. Consolidate small, related micro-tasks into batch issues.
5. **Premise-obsolete & stale check**: If an issue's premise was resolved by already-merged PRs or recent refactors, close as completed with evidence.
6. **Label audit**: Ensure open issues carry standard role labels (`needs-triage`, `ready-for-agent`, `needs-human`, etc.). Use `/triage` if classifying incoming issues.
7. **Closed-loop verification check**: For projects running impact or verification loops, audit recently closed roadmap/feature issues against tracking issues to ensure shipped levers do not remain untracked.

### Phase 3: Summary

8. Post a summary comment or log recording all actions taken (priority shifts, closed duplicates, released claims, landed log PRs).

## Logging

After completing (SUCCESS or FAILURE), write a log file to `.github/prompts/logs/issues-housekeeping/{timestamp}.md` following the schema in `.github/prompts/logs/_template.md`. Include:
- Prompt SHA
- Tally of issues audited, claims released, PRs merged
- List of closed or modified issues

**Important**: Commit the log file directly to `main` and push. Follow the Log delivery fallback in `ORCHESTRATION.md` if direct push fails.
